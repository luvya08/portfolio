   YOUR PORTFOLIO — THIS IS THE ONLY FILE YOU NEED TO EDIT.

   How to use it:
     1. Find the section you want to change (they are in big boxes like this).
     2. Change the text between the "quotes".
     3. Save the file. The website updates by itself.

   Three small rules that will save you a lot of pain:
     - Keep the quotes "like this" around every piece of text.
     - Keep the commas , at the end of each line.
     - If you want a double quote inside your text, write it as \"

   To hide a whole section: delete everything between its [ ] brackets,
   so it looks like  export const projects = [];  — the section disappears
   from the page and from the menu automatically.

   ========================================================================== */

/* ==========================================================================
   1. COLOURS
   Pick one accent colour. It is used for links, buttons and highlights.

   Some good ones to copy-paste:
     Coral   "#E8542E"      Forest  "#2F7A5B"      Indigo  "#4F5BD5"
     Plum    "#8B3A62"      Ocean   "#1D6F8C"      Gold    "#B8860B"
   ========================================================================== */

export const theme = {
  accent: "#E8542E", // colour used in light mode
  accentDark: "#FF7A50", // slightly brighter version for dark mode
};

/* ==========================================================================
   2. WHO YOU ARE
   This is the big text at the top of the page.
   Leave any line as ""  (empty) to hide it.
   ========================================================================== */

export const profile = {
  name: "Luvya Goyal",
